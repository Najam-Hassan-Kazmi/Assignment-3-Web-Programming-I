Have a look at my FIRST EVER Portfolio website! This contains HTML and CSS for now, and I will be adding JavaScript as well as React to this very soon. Let's see what happens with this experience.

This is the assignment for week 1 in the course "Web Programming I". We are required to create a portfolio website with some rules and conditions, using the material that had been provided.

We had to make 4 pages that were linked to the main page i.e. index.html.The others are named cv.html, hobbies.html and contact.html.

There is a file named style.css for the css rules as well to make the website a bit organized.

The course name is Web Programming where our basic tasks were to learn HTML, CSS and GitHub and some more in the next assignments. This assignment was for the Assignment 3 which helped me to learn Git and GitHub. Here are the exact requirements:

Creating repositories
Create a new repository on GitHub and give it a relevant name. The repository should have a MIT license and a README file

Clone the repository on your computer. You may use the terminal or VS code

Move the files from the previous assignment to the folder of the project that you have just created

Basic commands and conflicts
Run the necessary git commands to create a commit of the project and upload it to the remote repository

Now create a new branch named dev

Do NOT switch to the branch (stay in main)

Now edit the first line of the README file using Githubâ€™s web editor by adding your username next to it

Now, WITHOUT DOWNLOADING THE LATEST CHANGES FROM THE REMOTE REPOSITORY, edit the same line from VS code by adding the year 2024

Once done, try to pull the remote repository (main branch)

There will be a conflict since the same line has been changed simultaneously. Fix the conflict and do all the necessary steps to create a new commit in which the content of that line includes both the username and the year

Once fixed and commit, upload the changes to the remote repository

Branches
Now switch to the dev branch that you created earlier

Modify/add one css rule

Commit the changes 

Move back to the main branch and integrate the new changes from the dev branch

Push the main branch which has the latest changes to the remote server

Delete the dev branch locally

Github pages
Make the content of the repository accessible through Github pages
